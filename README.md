# Data Analysis of Aids Clinical Trial Group Study

The data is from a randomized, double-blind, study of AIDS patients with advanced immune suppression and
CD4 counts of less than or equal to 50 cells/mm3. The 1309 patients in this trial were randomized to one of
four daily regimens of a medication called Zidovudine. The goal of this project is to compare the effect of
treatment types on the changes in log CD4 cell count counts over time.
